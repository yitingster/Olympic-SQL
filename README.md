# Olympic-SQL

<h1>Introduction </h1>
<p> 
Hello everyone, this is a practice for me to test my application of SQL concept. I found this practice from an online blog with the link shown below. The datasets are from Kaggle, containing 120 years of Olympic History dataset from the user rgriffin. For convenience, I have also uploaded the datasets in the respository under the <b>Olympic_data folder</b>.
